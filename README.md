# Assignment 1: Mobile App UI Design and Implementation

## Objective
The objective of this assignment is to design and implement a basic mobile app UI using AI-generated designs and Android XML layouts. This will involve creating screens, implementing navigation, and applying best practices based on Material 3 guidelines.

## Requirements

### Part 1: UI Design (10%)

1. **Design Creation:**
   - Use the 'AI design copilot - text to UI generatorâ€™ AI plugin in Figma to generate designs for three screens:
     - **Login Screen**
     - **Home Screen (Dashboard)**
     - **Settings Screen**
   
2. **Export Designs:**
   - Export the designs as image files from Figma.

### Part 2: Implementation (55%)

1. **Android Project Setup:**
   - Create an Android project with three `Activity` classes, each corresponding to one of the three screens.

2. **UI Implementation:**
   - Implement the UI for each screen using XML layouts, ensuring the implementation closely matches the AI-generated designs.

3. **Navigation:**
   - Implement navigation between the three screens.

4. **Icons and Images:**
   - Use icons and image resources from the Figma design in your implementation. Note: This includes creating drawables from vector resources and using them in XML.

### Part 3: Report (35%)

1. **Report Content:**
   - Write a 500-word report on good design practices based on the latest Material 3 guidelines for Android.
     - **Top of the Report:**
       - Include the set of prompts assigned to you.
       - Include the images of the designs generated in Figma.
     
     - **Report Sections:**
       - **Key Principles of Material 3 Design:**
         - Cover the core principles of Material 3 design, including theming, components, and interaction design.
       
       - **Application of Principles in Modern Android App Development:**
         - Describe how Material 3 principles are applied in Android app development to enhance user experience and interface consistency.
       
       - **Best Practices for Implementing Material 3:**
         - Provide best practices for implementing Material 3 in Android applications, focusing on layout, theming, and user interactions.
