Assignment 1: Mobile App UI Design and Implementation
Objective
Design and implement a basic mobile app UI using AI-generated designs and Android XML
layouts, incorporating the knowledge and concepts you have learned so far.
Each student is provided with a unique set of prompts for an app design. (You are only
allowed to use the app & prompt assigned to you)
Requirements
Part 1: UI Design (10%)
1. Use the 'AI design copilot - text to UI generator’ AI plugin in Figma to generate
designs for 3 screens:
o Login screen
o Home screen (dashboard)
o Settings screen
2. Export the designs as image files.
Part 2: Implementation (55%)
1. Create an Android project with 3 Activity classes corresponding to the 3 screens.
2. Implement the UI for each screen using XML layouts, matching the AI-generated
designs as closely as possible.
3. Implement navigation between the 3 screens.
4. Use the icons and image resources from the Figma design in your implementation.
o Note: Creating drawables from vector resources and using them in XML hasn't
been covered in the lecture slides. Part of the marks will be for showcasing
your initiative to self-learn these concepts.
Part 3: Report (35%)
Write a 500-word report on good design practices based on the latest Material 3 guidelines
for Android. Your report should cover:
 At the top of your report doc include the set of prompts assigned to you and also
include the image of the designs generated in Figma ( similar to the example in the
last slide of Lecture 3 )
 Key principles of Material 3 design
 How these principles are applied in modern Android app development
 Best practices for implementing Material 3 in Android applications
